How to Run:
- You can just run the code.
- You might get the warnings saying "warnings.warn( ConvergenceWarning: Stochastic Optimizer: Maximum iterations (100) reached and the optimization hasn't converged 
yet."
-I've tried to adjust iteration to remove this warning, but when I adjusted the interation, the some of the lines from loss vs epoch were cut before they did not approches the iteration
- I attached py and ipynb(colab) because I write the code through 'colab'. 

Libraries
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (sklearn.preprocessing, neural_network, metrics sklearn.model_selection)
- Matplotlib
- seaborn

If the data is failed to bring out, this is the dataset that I used for this project
Dataset: "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"

Description:
- This homework is to write to find out the opimization hyperparameters for the neural network.
